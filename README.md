# Applied ML & DL

This repository contains applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects implemented in Python.

## Structure
- deep-learning/ → Deep Learning models (CNN, future RNN)
- machine-learning/ → Classical ML and ANN models

Each subfolder contains its own README with project-specific details.
